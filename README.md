# Semantic release utils playground
Playground for testing github actions that help us to build a wonderful semantic-release pipeline.  

1. `wagoid/commitlint-github-action` checks commit messages to fit semantic release rules
2. `fingerprintjs/action-semantic-release-info` prepares meta information about future release

Final test: branch should trigger a release
